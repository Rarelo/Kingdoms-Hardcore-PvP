## Current Issues
- sourceberries and golden apples can't be eaten by werewolf/carnivores
- get some tools mod because villagers are not fun
- craftable tridents?
- cheaper create recipe for tracks?
- roasted mutton chops weird for vegetarians bugged
- maybe music mobs could drop music disks?    tag     "spawnedWithBackpack",
- werewolf trinket drops are like way too rare, apparently vampires also get them from hunters
- avian active ability can toggle slow fall and maybe also jump boost
- can also make arachnid night vision toggable
- make dirt with brewing or something?
- could fish up trash ancient tomes and trade them to villagers
- worst case senario make disguise hide hunters from mobs but not players, quick respawn
- add moon charm crafting recipe
- heavy armor (try to enforce being slow), better than netherite?, takes diamonds to cope a higher durability?
- Tier 3 ars armor currently uncraftable because of chorus fruit

Continue updating origins with new featues and system
- make it so people don't need to use the scoreboard for origins
- maybe merlings have a (quite short) blinding ink attack and a related item drop
