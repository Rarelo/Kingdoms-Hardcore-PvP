Setting Up a Server

Here are the steps you'll need to follow to need to follow to set up your own server for this modpack 
(or probably any other forge modpack) from scratch.

1. Go to the forge website and grab the installer for forge. This modpack uses version 43.2.3. Install it in a empty folder
2. Run run.bat (or .sh for linux) once. It will create some extra folders so you don't need to
3. Copy all the mods from the downloaded singleplayer modpack into the mods folder. 
Then delete the darkness-forge-mc and fadingnightvision mod jars because they are client only and crashes the server if kept
4. Copy all the configs from the modpack into the config folder
5. Copy the modpack's scripts folder into the main server folder. If another pack uses another scripting mod like KubeJS instead of
craftweaker this will be slightly different.
6. Create a "world" folder in your main server folder, then inside it create a "datapacks" and "serverconfig" folder. 
Misspelling these folders will cause the files contained in them to not work
7. Copy the configuration files from the singleplayer "Datapack World" serverconfig to the server's serverconfig folder
8. Copy the datapacks included in the "Datapack World" "datapacks" folder into your server world's new "datapacks" folder
9. The server should automatically start up with the scripts, configs, and datapack working in your world. 
If you want a sanity check, you can reference your files you just set up against this modpack's downloadable sever zips
